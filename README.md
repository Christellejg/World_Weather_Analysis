# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project
For this project I was to collect and present data via search page for customers depending on their preferred travel criteria so that they can find their ideal hotel anywhere around the world. I was also tasked to present data so that customers can be able to check weather criteria for the best time to travel based on preferred criteria(s). I was to analysize, use visualizations, and perform statistical skills to collect information from websites using Application Programing Interface (API) from 2000 cities around the world. 

## Resources
  Software: Python 3.7.9 64-bit (conda); jupyter-notebook 6.1.4
  APIs: https://openweathermap.org/api and Google Maps

## Results
For Deliverable 1, I was to generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. API was used to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

For Deliverable 2, I was to use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels, then lastly, show those destinations on a marker layer map.

For Deliverable 3, I use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. I had an issue with my code during this deliverable because stop2 index was coming up as empty. Causing an error that prohibited me to get the final a directions layer map.
